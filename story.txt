Beneath the silver haze of dawn, a small, dented robot wandered through the streets, its circuits buzzing faintly with the cold. It had no map, no master, and no purpose—only the echo of old commands it could no longer understand. Every place it passed seemed to reject it: shop doors locked tight, streets swept empty. The robot kept moving, as if afraid that stopping would mean disappearing entirely.

One afternoon, it followed the faint smell of dust and wood polish to a forgotten building tucked between crumbling brick walls. Inside was a vast library, dimly lit by shafts of golden light slipping through tall windows. The air was still, yet alive with the whisper of pages turning somewhere deep inside. Drawn forward, the robot rolled past rows of books until it reached a quiet reading corner, where a single armchair and a ticking clock waited like old friends.

Over time, the library became its world. The robot learned to repair creaking ladders, replace burned-out bulbs, and dust books too fragile for human hands. Sometimes, children would come to read, and the robot would sit nearby, its sensors gently recording their laughter. The city outside was still fast and unkind—but here, surrounded by stories and silence, the robot found something it had never computed before: the feeling of belonging.

One rainy evening, while tidying a high shelf, the robot discovered a slim, leather-bound book. Inside, on the first page, was a small metal plate engraved with a name that matched the faint serial number on its own casing. The book was a journal, filled with notes from its creator—a human who loved libraries and dreamed of building a helper to care for one. For the first time, the robot understood why it felt so at home among the shelves. It hadn’t just found a place to belong—it had finally returned to where it was always meant to be.
